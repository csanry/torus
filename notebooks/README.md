## Notebooks  


#### Introduction 

- Notebooks primarily for testing of code snippets 

- Suggested workflow: create a personal `.ipynb` for yourself 

```bash
cd notebooks
touch <notebook_name>.ipynb
```

- If you require some help, add a code snippet to your personal notebook for the team to review

- Notebooks should not contain any critical system code; this is purely for rapid testing
